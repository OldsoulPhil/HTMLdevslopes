All projects and creations created with Devslopes! 

Hello,

If you are visiting this, that means you are wanting to check out my work and what I have learned as a devslope apprentice!

Please go ahead and click on any of the files that I have included. Most of them are just snipets of HTML code that I have learned through out my studying!

There are some exercises where I code out everything based on what I know. I also have projects I was tasked with to complete to present what I have learned.
