    <p>This is the very start of an adventure for young Frodo Baggins. He first gets lost from his party on a river with
      his best friend Sam. Both of them sneak off into the wild together to finish what they started. What they do not
      realize is that they could have just taken the eagles that Gandolf ha originally called for. But they did not
      listen and they took a whole vacation that they almost died from.</p>

      <h3><em>Opinion:</em></h3>
      This is just my <em>opinion</em> and this has no actual facts to my statement. I do not think this was the best
      one because
      of all the stuff that happened that did not really have any actions to it.
